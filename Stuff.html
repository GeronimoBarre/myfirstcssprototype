            <p>
              The Black Mesa Science Team is the overwhelming majority of Black Mesa's population. With the Black Mesa Security Force, it is one of the most important bodies of the Black Mesa personnel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each scientist is granted a different security clearance specific to his or her duty, with an average clearance of Level 5. Like other employees, scientists have an assigned uniform, consisting of a blue shirt, white lab coat, red striped tie and white (or beige) slacks. In Opposing Force, a cleansuit-wearing variation of the normal scientist appears in limited areas. Some scientists are trained in the use of the MP5 submachine gun as part of Hazard Course training, but most have little or no combat skills or experience.

            <p>
              Revenants are monsters introduced in Doom II that are easily recognized by their high-pitched shriek. They take the form of very tall animated skeletons with golden-brown bones, in metallic silver body armor equipped with shoulder-mounted missile launchers, and blood and gore running down their ribcage and legs. Their running movements are akin to a stringed puppet.

            <p>
              In Quake, a Shambler is a large yeti-like beast with a blood-stained skin, a very large mouth displaying enormous fangs, no visible eyes, and sharp claws. The Shambler has a complete lack of facial expression. His furious melee claw smash does enormous damage, and at a distance, he can attack by projecting a beam of electricity towards his opponent. His electric attack will only work if he sees his enemy when it ends his charging up animation. Otherwise, he'll miss.
